This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## TypeScript vs JavaScript

This project demonstrates key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, highlighting:
- Strong typing in TypeScript vs dynamic typing in JavaScript
- Interface and type definitions available in TypeScript
- Enhanced IDE support and error checking with TypeScript
- Compatibility between TypeScript and JavaScript
- Better refactoring capabilities with TypeScript

### Practical TypeScript Advantages

#### Type Safety
TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime. For example:

```typescript
// TypeScript
function calculateTotal(price: number, quantity: number): number {
  return price * quantity;
}

// This would cause a compile-time error
calculateTotal("10", 5); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```

In JavaScript, this would only fail at runtime or produce unexpected results.

#### Developer Experience
TypeScript provides better autocompletion, inline documentation, and refactoring tools:

```typescript
// With proper typing, editors can suggest all available methods
const user = {
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
  preferences: {
    theme: "dark",
    notifications: true
  }
};

// Editor can autocomplete all properties
user.preferences.theme; // Autocomplete works for deeply nested properties
```

#### Interfaces and Type Definitions
TypeScript allows defining clear contracts for your code:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "user" | "guest"; // Union types for specific values
  lastLogin?: Date; // Optional properties
}

// Function that requires a User object
function updateUser(user: User): void {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Gradual Adoption
You can migrate JavaScript to TypeScript incrementally:
1. Rename `.js` files to `.ts`
2. Configure `tsconfig.json` with `"allowJs": true`
3. Add types gradually as you refactor code
4. Use `// @ts-ignore` or `any` type for complex cases initially

#### Real-world Benefits
- **Reduced Bugs**: Studies show TypeScript can prevent ~15% of bugs that would occur in JavaScript
- **Better Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation
- **Safer Refactoring**: The compiler catches breaking changes
- **Team Scalability**: Easier onboarding and collaboration in large codebases

### When to Use JavaScript Instead
- Small projects with limited complexity
- Prototyping and rapid development (though TypeScript can be configured for this too)
- When team familiarity with TypeScript is low
- Scripts with minimal dependencies and simple functionality

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
